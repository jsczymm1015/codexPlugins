# Particle Systems in Godot 4.3+

All examples target Godot 4.3+ with no deprecated APIs. GDScript is shown first, then C#.

> **Related skills:** **shader-basics** for custom particle shaders, **3d-essentials** for lighting and environment that affect particles, **2d-essentials** for 2D rendering context, **tween-animation** for code-driven VFX timing, **godot-optimization** for particle performance tuning.

## 1. Core Concepts

### GPU vs CPU Particles

| Node                | Processing | Features                                | Use For                        |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `GPUParticles2D`    | GPU        | Full features, high counts, trails      | Most 2D effects                |
| `GPUParticles3D`    | GPU        | Full features, attractors, collision    | Most 3D effects                |
| `CPUParticles2D`    | CPU        | Simpler, no trails/attractors           | Low-end devices, few particles |
| `CPUParticles3D`    | CPU        | Simpler, no trails/attractors           | Low-end devices, few particles |

**Rule of thumb:** Use GPU particles by default. Switch to CPU particles only for low-end/web targets or when you need CPU-side particle positions (e.g., spawning objects at particle locations).

> You can convert between GPU and CPU particles in the editor: select the node → toolbar → **Convert to CPUParticles2D/3D** (or vice versa).

### Particle System Architecture

```
GPUParticles2D/3D
├── Process Material (ParticleProcessMaterial)   ← physics, emission, color
├── Draw Pass 1 (Mesh)                            ← what each particle looks like
└── (Optional) Draw Pass 2-4                      ← additional meshes
```

### Minimal Setup

1. Add a **GPUParticles2D** (or 3D) node
2. In Inspector → Process Material → **New ParticleProcessMaterial**
3. Set **Amount** (number of particles)
4. Configure emission, direction, velocity, gravity
5. (2D) Set **Texture** for particle appearance
6. (3D) Set **Draw Pass 1** mesh (QuadMesh for billboards, or custom mesh)

## 2. Key Node Properties

### GPUParticles2D/3D Properties

| Property          | Type     | Description                                         |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `emitting`        | `bool`   | Start/stop emission                                 |
| `amount`          | `int`    | Total particles alive at once                       |
| `lifetime`        | `float`  | Seconds each particle lives                         |
| `one_shot`        | `bool`   | Emit once then stop                                 |
| `preprocess`      | `float`  | Simulate this many seconds before first frame       |
| `speed_scale`     | `float`  | Time multiplier for particle physics                |
| `explosiveness`   | `float`  | 0.0 = spread over lifetime, 1.0 = all at once      |
| `fixed_fps`       | `int`    | Lock particle update rate (0 = match render FPS)    |
| `local_coords`    | `bool`   | Particles move with the node (true) or stay in world (false) |
| `draw_order`      | `enum`   | Index, Lifetime, or Reverse Lifetime                |
| `amount_ratio`    | `float`  | Fraction of particles to emit (0.0–1.0)             |

### One-Shot vs Continuous

```gdscript
# Continuous emitter (fire, smoke, ambient dust)
$GPUParticles2D.one_shot = false
$GPUParticles2D.emitting = true

# One-shot burst (explosion, impact splash)
$GPUParticles2D.one_shot = true
$GPUParticles2D.emitting = false  # arm it
# Later, trigger:
$GPUParticles2D.restart()
$GPUParticles2D.emitting = true
```

```csharp
// Continuous
var particles = GetNode<GpuParticles2D>("GPUParticles2D");
particles.OneShot = false;
particles.Emitting = true;

// One-shot burst
particles.OneShot = true;
particles.Emitting = false;
// Trigger:
particles.Restart();
particles.Emitting = true;
```

### Local Billboard Alignment (Godot 4.7+)

`GPUParticles3D` gains `TRANSFORM_ALIGN_LOCAL_BILLBOARD` (`= 4`): each particle's Z axis faces the camera while preserving a given axis — X or Y, chosen via `transform_align_axis`. For billboarded particles, `transform_align_channel_filter` selects which custom channel to read to calculate their angle. `ParticleProcessMaterial` pairs this with per-axis rotation velocity: enable `use_rotation_velocity_3d`, then set `rotation_velocity_3d_min/max` (`Vector3`, on the particle's local axes) and optionally `rotation_velocity_3d_curve` (per-axis curve over lifetime).

```gdscript
# 3D only — billboard toward the camera while keeping the Y axis fixed.
# Assumes a ParticleProcessMaterial is assigned (section 1 setup).
$GPUParticles3D.transform_align = GPUParticles3D.TRANSFORM_ALIGN_LOCAL_BILLBOARD
$GPUParticles3D.transform_align_axis = RenderingServer.PARTICLES_ALIGN_AXIS_Y

var mat: ParticleProcessMaterial = $GPUParticles3D.process_material
mat.use_rotation_velocity_3d = true
mat.rotation_velocity_3d_min = Vector3(-2.0, 0.0, 0.0)
mat.rotation_velocity_3d_max = Vector3(2.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

```csharp
// Assumes a ParticleProcessMaterial is assigned (section 1 setup).
var particles = GetNode<GpuParticles3D>("GPUParticles3D");
particles.TransformAlign = GpuParticles3D.TransformAlignEnum.LocalBillboard;
particles.TransformAlignAxis = RenderingServer.ParticlesTransformAlignAxis.Y;

var mat = (ParticleProcessMaterial)particles.ProcessMaterial;
mat.UseRotationVelocity3D = true;
mat.RotationVelocity3DMin = new Vector3(-2.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
mat.RotationVelocity3DMax = new Vector3(2.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
```

---

## 3. ParticleProcessMaterial — Essential Properties

The material drives per-particle behavior: **emission shape** (Point / Sphere / Box / Ring / Points / Directed Points), **direction + spread + initial velocity**, **gravity**, **scale and color over lifetime** (via `scale_curve` / `color_ramp`), **damping**, **radial/tangential acceleration**, and **angular velocity**.

> See [references/process-material-basics.md](references/process-material-basics.md) for the emission-shape table and GDScript + C# snippets for each property group.

### Per-Axis 3D Scale & Rotation (Godot 4.7+)

Randomize scale and initial orientation per axis instead of uniformly. `use_scale_3d` enables `scale_3d_min/max` (`Vector3` random scale per particle); `use_rotation_3d` enables `rotation_3d_min/max` (`Vector3`, degrees — works only in 3D).

```gdscript
mat.use_scale_3d = true
mat.scale_3d_min = Vector3(0.5, 1.0, 0.5)
mat.scale_3d_max = Vector3(1.0, 2.0, 1.0)

mat.use_rotation_3d = true  # 3D only
mat.rotation_3d_min = Vector3(0.0, -180.0, 0.0)  # degrees
mat.rotation_3d_max = Vector3(0.0, 180.0, 0.0)
```

```csharp
mat.UseScale3D = true;
mat.Scale3DMin = new Vector3(0.5f, 1.0f, 0.5f);
mat.Scale3DMax = new Vector3(1.0f, 2.0f, 1.0f);

mat.UseRotation3D = true;  // 3D only
mat.Rotation3DMin = new Vector3(0.0f, -180.0f, 0.0f);  // degrees
mat.Rotation3DMax = new Vector3(0.0f, 180.0f, 0.0f);
```

### Inheriting Emitter Scale (Godot 4.7+)

`particle_flag_inherit_emitter_scale` (default `false`): if `true`, particles inherit the scale of the emitter node. Has no effect when `local_coords` is `true`, since particles in local space are already affected by the emitter's scale.

```gdscript
mat.particle_flag_inherit_emitter_scale = true
```

```csharp
mat.ParticleFlagInheritEmitterScale = true;
```

## 4. Common VFX Recipes

The recipes most projects need: **fire** (2D, looped emission with hot-color gradient + scale-down), **explosion burst** (one-shot, high-amount short-lifetime), **dust / footstep puff** (one-shot, scale-up + rapid fade).

> See [references/vfx-recipes.md](references/vfx-recipes.md) for ready-to-use GDScript wiring and recommended `ParticleProcessMaterial` settings for all three.

---

## 5. Trails (Forward+ and Mobile only)

Set `trail_enabled = true` on `GPUParticles2D/3D` and assign a `Mesh` (`RibbonTrailMesh` or `TubeTrailMesh`). Trails are NOT supported in the Compatibility renderer.

> See [references/trails.md](references/trails.md) for the setup and trail-mesh-type comparison.

---

## 6. Subemitters

A particle can spawn another particle scene at lifecycle events (birth, collision, death, manual). Configure via `ParticleProcessMaterial.SubEmitterMode` + `subemitter` property on the parent particles node.

> See [references/subemitters.md](references/subemitters.md) for trigger modes, scene setup, GDScript and C# (v1.6.0 parity), and limitations.

> ⚠️ **Changed in Godot 4.7:** Subemitter velocity inheritance was reworked ([GH-118062](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/118062)). With `sub_emitter_keep_velocity = true` (default `false`), subemitted particles inherit the parent particle's velocity when they spawn. Subemitter effects authored on earlier versions may look different after upgrading — re-check initial velocity and spread on affected systems.

---

## 7. Attractors & Collision (3D)

`GPUParticlesAttractor*3D` (Box / Sphere / Vector Field) pulls particles toward a region. `GPUParticlesCollision*3D` (Box / Sphere / SDF / HeightField) lets particles bounce off geometry. Both Forward+/Mobile only; no 2D equivalents.

> See [references/attractors-and-collision.md](references/attractors-and-collision.md) for full setup of each attractor and collision type.

---

## 8. Turbulence

Set `turbulence_enabled = true` on `ParticleProcessMaterial` and tune `turbulence_noise_strength` (0.5–2.0 typical), `turbulence_noise_scale` (lower = larger swirls), `turbulence_noise_speed` (animate the noise field). Cheap effect for "alive" smoke, fire, dust.

---

## 9. Flipbook Animation (2D)

Sprite-sheet animated particles via `ParticleProcessMaterial.AnimSpeedMin/Max` + `CanvasItemMaterial.ParticlesAnimHFrames/VFrames` for the sheet layout. Particles cycle through frames over their lifetime.

> See [references/flipbook-animation.md](references/flipbook-animation.md) for the full setup with GDScript + C# (v1.6.0 parity).

## 10. Performance Tips

| Technique                    | Savings              | When to Use                          |
|------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Lower `amount`               | Linear GPU savings   | Always — use minimum needed          |
| `fixed_fps = 30`             | Halves particle updates | Background particles, ambient       |
| `amount_ratio` < 1.0         | Scale down dynamically | Quality settings slider              |
| Smaller textures             | Less VRAM + bandwidth | Mobile, many particle systems        |
| `local_coords = true`        | Cheaper transforms   | When particles should move with node |
| Disable `turbulence`         | Removes 3D noise cost | Mobile/web targets                   |
| Fewer `trail_sections`       | Less trail geometry  | When trail smoothness isn't critical |
| `visibility_rect` (2D)       | Skips off-screen     | Always set for 2D particles          |

### Seeking the Particle Timeline (Godot 4.7+)

`request_particles_process(process_time, process_time_residual = 0.0)` — on `GPUParticles2D/3D` and `CPUParticles2D/3D` — requests extra process time during a single frame. `process_time` is simulated with emitting on; the 4.7-added `process_time_residual` is simulated with emitting turned off. Combined with `speed_scale = 0.0`, this lets you seek a paused particle system's timeline (e.g., scrubbing VFX in a cutscene or replay).

```gdscript
$GPUParticles3D.speed_scale = 0.0
# Simulate 1.5s with emission on, then 0.25s with emission off
$GPUParticles3D.request_particles_process(1.5, 0.25)
```

```csharp
var particles = GetNode<GpuParticles3D>("GPUParticles3D");
particles.SpeedScale = 0.0f;
particles.RequestParticlesProcess(1.5f, 0.25f);
```

### Dynamic Quality Scaling

```gdscript
# Adjust particle density based on quality setting
func set_particle_quality(level: float) -> void:
    # level: 0.25 (low) to 1.0 (high)
    for particles in get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("particles"):
        if particles is GPUParticles2D or particles is GPUParticles3D:
            particles.amount_ratio = level
```

```csharp
public void SetParticleQuality(float level)
{
    foreach (var node in GetTree().GetNodesInGroup("particles"))
    {
        if (node is GpuParticles2D p2d)
            p2d.AmountRatio = level;
        else if (node is GpuParticles3D p3d)
            p3d.AmountRatio = level;
    }
}
```

## 11. Common Pitfalls

| Symptom                              | Cause                                          | Fix                                                              |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Particles invisible                  | No texture (2D) or no draw pass mesh (3D)       | Set texture or assign a mesh to Draw Pass 1                      |
| Particles appear then vanish immediately | `lifetime` too short                         | Increase `lifetime` (default 1.0s)                               |
| One-shot doesn't re-trigger          | Need to call `restart()` before setting `emitting = true` | Call `restart()` then set `emitting = true`            |
| Particles emit in wrong direction    | `direction` or `gravity` misconfigured          | In 2D, Y is inverted — upward is `Vector3(0, -1, 0)`            |
| Particles don't follow the node      | `local_coords` is `false`                       | Set `local_coords = true` for attached effects                   |
| Particles pop in (no pre-warming)    | No `preprocess` time set                        | Set `preprocess` to 1–2x `lifetime` for ambient effects          |
| Color ramp has no effect             | Using `color` property which overrides ramp      | Clear the base `color` (set to white) when using `color_ramp`    |
| Trails not rendering                 | Missing trail material setup or wrong renderer   | Enable "Use Particle Trails" on material; use Forward+ or Mobile |
| Attractors have no effect            | `attractor_interaction_enabled` is `false`       | Enable on the ParticleProcessMaterial                            |
| Subemitter not spawning              | Child `amount` is too low to accommodate spawns  | Increase child system's `amount`                                 |
| Particles flicker on mobile          | `fixed_fps` not set or too high                  | Set `fixed_fps = 30` for consistency across devices              |

## 12. Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Particle `amount` is set to the minimum needed for the visual effect
- [ ] `lifetime` matches the visual duration — not too short or too long
- [ ] `one_shot` is enabled for burst effects (explosions, impacts)
- [ ] `preprocess` is set for always-visible ambient effects (fire, smoke, dust)
- [ ] Emission shape matches the source geometry (sphere for explosions, box for area effects)
- [ ] `color_ramp` fades alpha to 0 at the end so particles don't vanish abruptly
- [ ] `scale_curve` shrinks particles over lifetime for natural fade
- [ ] `local_coords` is set correctly — `true` for attached effects, `false` for world-space
- [ ] One-shot particles are cleaned up with `queue_free` after `lifetime` + margin
- [ ] `visibility_rect` (2D) is set to prevent particles from being culled prematurely
- [ ] Dynamic quality scaling uses `amount_ratio` for player-accessible quality settings
- [ ] Performance-heavy features (turbulence, trails) are disabled on low-end targets
